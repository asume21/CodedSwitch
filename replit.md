# Overview
CodedSwitch is an AI-powered bidirectional translation platform that bridges code development with music creation. It offers circular translation where code generates music that can translate back to similar source code. The platform provides an integrated development environment for translating code between programming languages, generating musical compositions from code structures, converting music back to functional code, creating beats and melodies, scanning code for security vulnerabilities, writing lyrics, and intelligently layering instruments. CodedSwitch aims to redefine the interaction between logical and creative disciplines, offering a unique value proposition in both software development and music production markets.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The client-side uses React 18 with TypeScript, following a component-based architecture. Vite is used for builds, and state management is handled via React hooks, context, and TanStack Query for server state. The UI is built with shadcn/ui and Radix UI primitives, styled with Tailwind CSS in a custom dark theme. The Web Audio API powers the custom AudioEngine for synthesis and playback, with Wouter handling client-side routing. The interface provides a unified workflow for song upload, AI analysis, and music generation, including a professional studio for high-quality audio output and integrated transport controls with playlist management.

## Backend Architecture
The server is a RESTful API built with Express.js and TypeScript, separating concerns into service layers for OpenAI, audio processing, and data storage. It includes middleware for logging, error handling, and JSON parsing. An interface-based storage layer (IStorage) abstracts database operations for various project entities. The platform integrates a self-protecting security system that scans all file uploads using its own AI technology, ensuring platform integrity and demonstrating product capability.

## Database Design
PostgreSQL is used with Drizzle ORM for type-safe operations. The schema includes tables for users, projects, code translations, beat patterns, melodies, vulnerability scans, and lyrics, utilizing UUID primary keys and foreign key relationships. The database is configured for Neon Database, with Drizzle Kit for migrations.

## AI Integration Architecture
OpenAI's GPT-4o model is integrated for features like code translation, beat generation, melody composition, security scanning, lyric generation, and intelligent assistance. All AI interactions are server-side, with the backend proxying requests to OpenAI. The AI system includes advanced vocal detection, intelligent lyric analysis, and a conversation memory system for context retention.

## Audio Processing Pipeline
The audio engine features Web Audio API synthesis for electronic instrument and drum sounds. Drum sounds use oscillators and noise layers with natural decay. The system supports real-time playback with live pattern editing, visual timing indicators, mixer functionality, and transport controls. It generates electronic instrumentals with beat patterns, melodies, and basic song arrangements. The platform includes a professional mixer studio for layering beats with melodies and applying EQ, effects, and mastering controls.

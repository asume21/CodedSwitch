# High-Quality Drum Samples for CodedSwitch Beat Studio

The Beat Studio engine will automatically load **any** `.wav` files found in this directory and map them to the corresponding instrument names:

| Instrument Key | Expected Filename |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| kick           | `kick.wav`       |
| snare          | `snare.wav`      |
| hihat          | `hihat.wav`      |
| openhat        | `openhat.wav`    |

Simply drop your favourite samples here (44.1 kHz, mono/stereo) and they will be used instead of the built-in synthesised drums.

*If the directory is empty the engine falls back to its basic synth drums.*

# CodedSwitch – Pitch Deck Outline (import-ready)

---
## 1. Title & Vision
CodedSwitch – *Where Coders & Rappers Meet*

* AI code translator + security scanner + music creation suite
* Bridging software & musical creativity through a **triple-entendre**: code-language switching, linguistic code-switching (lyrics), and domain switching (dev ↔ music)

---
## 2. Problem & Opportunity

**Pain**
* Devs waste hours migrating code between languages.
* Security vulnerabilities slip through manual reviews.
* Creators juggle separate tools for code and music.

**Opportunity**
* 26 M devs + 60 M hobby musicians lack a unifying tool.
* Rising demand for AI-assisted code migration and creative workflows.

## 4. Tech Stack & Defensibility

* Python 3.11 + ttkbootstrap GUI
* AI Interface → Gemini-pro + optional OpenAI fallback
* Module plug-in architecture (Translator, Security, Beat Studio)
* Offline model quantization for edge use
* First-mover advantage in dev-music crossover

---
## 5. Market & Impact

* **TAM:** 26 M devs switching languages yearly
* **SAM:** 4 M indie dev-musicians
* **Early Traction:** 450 downloads, 120 MAUs, 94 % faster migration
* **SDG 4:** Democratises access to advanced AI tools
* User quote: “Saved our team 40+ hours migrating Python to Node.js while catching critical vulns.”

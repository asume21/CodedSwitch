## 1-Page Project Overview (copy-paste ready)

**Problem**  
Multilingual code migration and security auditing drain time and block innovation, while musicians who code face a creative divide between software and music production.

**Solution ‚Äì CodedSwitch**  
Desktop app that:
* Translates code between Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, and PHP in seconds using Gemini-pro (Google) with optional OpenAI back-end.
* Runs an AI-aided security scan (OWASP / CWE) before deployment.
* Provides an AI chatbot (‚ÄúAstutely‚Äù) for instant programming help.
* Triple-entendre brand: ‚ÄúCode-switch‚Äù between programming languages, between human languages/rap lyrics, and between domains of software and music.
* "Lyric Lab + Beat Studio" makes this tangible, generating beats & lyrics that mirror the code being translated.

**Traction**  
Working Windows & Ubuntu build; 450 downloads (pre-release), 120 monthly active users; 94 % report faster code migration; 40+ starter beat patterns generated via Lyric Lab.

**Technology**  
Python 3.11, ttkbootstrap GUI, Google Gemini API, optional OpenAI API, pattern-based security engine, pydub/pygame audio synth, model quantization for offline use.

**Market & Impact**  
26 M developers changing languages yearly + 60 M hobby musicians. Addresses SDG 4 (quality education) by making advanced AI tooling accessible to self-learners.

**Roadmap / Credit Use**  
Month 1 ‚Äì move inference & storage to Vertex AI, enable cloud collaboration (US $500).  
Month 2 ‚Äì fine-tune translation models on Vertex Matching Engine (US $750).  
Month 3 ‚Äì ship real-time pair-programming & live beat collaborative beta (US $750).

**Team**  
`<<Your Name>>` ‚Äì Full-stack developer & audio engineer (5 yrs Python, Ableton Live).  
Looking for mentors in cost optimisation & AI safety.

**Ask**  
US $2 000‚Äì$10 000 in cloud credits + product mentorship.
